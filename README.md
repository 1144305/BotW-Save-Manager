# Breath of the Wild Save Manager

**Note: Make sure both versions of BotW have the same update version**

BotW Save Manager is a fork of https://github.com/WemI0/BOTW_SaveConv that at the moment can convert Switch <-> Wii U BotW save files. It currently has been written with .Net Framework for Windows with UI, and .Net Core (command-line only) for cross-compatibility. It is also planned to have support for save editing, with most of the code based on https://github.com/marcrobledo/savegame-editors/tree/master/zelda-botw.

## Dependencies:

* Windows
  * [.Net Framework 4.7](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55170)
* Other
  * .Net Core - varies by system
