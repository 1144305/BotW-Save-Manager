# BotW Save Manager

BotW Save Manager is a tool that at the moment can convert Switch <-> WiiU BOTW save files. It currently has only been written on the .Net Framework for Windows, but will also be written in .Net Core (command-line only) for cross-compatibility. It is also planned to have support for save editing, with most of the code based on https://github.com/marcrobledo/savegame-editors/tree/master/zelda-botw.

Usage: At the moment until basic functionality is complete you will have to compile it yourself and run it that way.

## Dependencies 
.Net Framework 4.7

**Note: Make sure both versions of BotW have the same update version**
